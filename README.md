# Anime and Fictional Image Generation with Diffusion Models

This project demonstrates how to use a diffusion model specifically trained for generating anime or fictional images. It leverages a narrow AI approach, where the model is fine-tuned for a particular task, in this case, creating anime-style images.

# Overview
The script utilizes the diffusers library, which provides a diffusion pipeline for image generation. It also employs accelerate for efficient inference with PyTorch and safetensors for fast tensor storage and loading. The generated image is displayed within a Colab environment using IPython display functions.
